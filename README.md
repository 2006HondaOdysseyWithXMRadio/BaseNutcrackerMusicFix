# BaseNutcrackerMusicFix

Stops the Nutcracker from restarting his song when he reloads. You can add this mod as a dependency to let your music mods play out in full.

### Why?

Every time a Nutcracker reloads, it restarts its song and changes the pitch. This means that when you mod a new song in, you'll only hear the first few seconds of your shiny new song.

## Changelog

### 1.0.0
